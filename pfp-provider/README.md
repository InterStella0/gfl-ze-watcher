# Steam Profile Picture Provider
This is a steam profile picture provider specifically
for GFL ZE Watcher. I wrote this privately but decided to release
it for the public as a reference. Rewrote it into Rust instead
of using Python.

This process is supposed to fetch profile from multiple providers, and making Steam API as the final fallback before
failing.
